  },
  {
    "question": "How does the MMU (Memory Management Unit) handle virtual addresses?",
    "answer": "The MMU maps logical to physical addresses by checking the valid-invalid bit in each page table entry. If a page is not in memory, it triggers a page fault and brings the page into memory."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when there's a page fault?",
    "answer": "When a page fault occurs, the operating system checks if the reference was invalid or just not in memory. It then swaps out another page to make room for the new one and restarts the instruction that caused the page fault."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is an extreme case of demand paging?",
    "answer": "An extreme case would be starting a process with no pages in memory, which triggers multiple page faults as each page is brought into memory on first access."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do we need hardware support for demand paging?",
    "answer": "We need hardware support for demand paging to handle the additional tasks of maintaining page tables and swapping out/in pages efficiently."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the performance overhead of demand paging?",
    "answer": "The performance overhead includes trap to operating system, saving user registers, determining page location on disk, reading from disk, allocating CPU time, and restarting process."
  },{
    "question": "How do we measure the effectiveness of demand paging?",
    "answer": "We can measure the effectiveness by calculating the Page Fault Rate (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) and Effective Access Time (EAT), which takes into account both memory access and page fault overheads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the valid-invalid bit in each page table entry?",
    "answer": "The valid-invalid bit indicates whether a page is currently in memory or not. If it's invalid, it triggers a page fault to bring the page into memory."
